Project Brief:
We're building a secure internal landing page to replace our current Event Preparation Google Docs. This page will allow Web3 projects launching on Decubate to input, review, and confirm all IDO-related information in one structured interface ‚Äî accessible only to their team.

üéØ Objectives:
Replace Google Docs with a centralized web platform

Each project should only access its own page

Projects can input and confirm data across multiple tabs

Decubate admins can create, monitor, and optionally edit any page
